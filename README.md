Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics toolboxes for MATLAB


The MATLAB package for astronomy and astrophysics is a a collection of software tools and modular functions for
astronomy and astrophysics, written in the MATLAB environment. It includes over 700 MATLAB functions, and a few
tens of data files and astronomical catalogs. The scripts cover a wide range of subjects including: astronomical image
processing, ds9 control, astronomical spectra, optics and diffraction phenomena, catalog retrieval and searches,
celestial maps and projections, Solar System ephemerides, planar and spherical geometry, time and coordinates conversion
and manipulation, cosmology, gravitational lensing, function fitting, general utilities, plotting utilities, statistics,
and time series analysis.
